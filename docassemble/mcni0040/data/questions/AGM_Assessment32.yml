code: |

  Loop 1: iterate over each row in the table (each item in the data block)

    Loop 2: iterate over each element in the list item (each key in the dictionary)
        Inside this second loop
        - get the key and value for that key
        - we will add them to a list so that it look like this: 'First Name: Asheligh' <- 'key: value'
          - this gets added to the AGMchoices key.

  for AGMitem in AGMperson_info:

    AGMitem['AGMchoices'] = []
    for AGMkey in AGMitem:
      value = AGMitem[AGMkey]
      AGMitem['AGMchoices'].append('information goes here ie: key and the value')
